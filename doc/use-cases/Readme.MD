Open Design studies to show how it looks when all workflows of a sub-project are completed. 

Then go back and to Consultancy supervision.

As Abbas Tutelle, assign the current workflow (Payment Interim Installment) to Rose Finance. 

Switching to Rose Finance, show that she now received a notification. 

The Finance Ministry can now pay the consultant the interim installment and then close the workflow as confirmation of the payment. 

Do so: Close the workflow as Rose Finance.

Go back to Abbas Tutelle to show that he is beeing notified that the workflow has been closed by Rose Finance. 


To show how external service providers such as a tender agent can be directly included in the process, go to Construction Lot 2.

Logout as Rose Finance. 

Login as Francis Tender.

As Abbas Tutelle, assign the current workflow (Tender evaluation) to Francis Tender. 

Show that Francis Tender received the notification.

He can now work on his task and once it is done, close the workflow item. 

Thereby, Abbas Tutelle will immediately see that the tender evaluation has been completed. 


To illustrate that also other service providers can be directly included, go to Construction Lot 1.

Logout as Francis Tender and login as Paul Chantier. 

As Abbas Tutelle assign the current workflow (Progress report) to Paul Chantier.

Use Paul Chantier (he is very fast in writting progress reports) to close it and once again Abbas to show the immediate notification.
